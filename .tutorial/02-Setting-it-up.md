# Setting up SECURE-NET (Ultraviolet)
## __*First step*__

fork this repl.
(you've probably already done this.)

Also, if you don't see the sidebar where you manage the files, do this.

## __*Second step* (Optional Step, but highly reccomended)__

Go to the `static` folder, then `index.html` or `ultraviolet.css`

Then if you want to, make some changes and cuztomize it. LEARN HTML and CSS, its EASY! 


```css
body {
    margin: 0;
    background: #111;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    min-height: 100vh;
}
```

>:point_up_2:I recommend changing and playing around with css code in `ultraviolet.css` :point_up_2:
